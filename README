Resilient, Scalable, IPv6 Network application
---------------------------------------------

:Author: Nexedi <re6stnet@erp5.org>

Overview
========

re6stnet creates a resilient, scalable, ipv6 network on top of an existing ipv4
network, by creating tunnels on the fly, and then routing targeted traffic
through these tunnels.

re6stnet can be used to :
- guarantee connectedness between computers connected to the
internet, for which there exists a working route ( in case the direct route
isn't available ).
- create very large networks
- give ipv6 addresses to machines with only ipv4 available


HOW IT WORKS
============

A re6stnet networks consists of at least one server ( re6st-registry ) and many
clients or nodes ( re6stnet ). The server delivers certificates for secure
authentification in establishing tunnels, and - for now - store the complete
list of nodes running.
re6stnet detects and take into accounts nodes present on the local network.

Resilience
----------
re6stnet can guarantee that if there exists a route between two machines,
traffic will be correctly routed between these two machines.
Since the destination of established connection are random, there can be no
guarantee that such a route exists given which tunnels are established, but
for big enough networks ( more than a hundred nodes ), the probability that
the network isn't connected is very low.

Scalability
-----------

Since each node has very few data about the network, re6stnet is easily
scalable to tens of thousand of nodes

Requirements
============

- Python 2.7 or later

- OpenSSL binary and development libraries

- OpenVPN

- Babel ( http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/babel/ )

Installation
============

Let's explain how to install the egg

.. XXX: write monkey-patch in __init__.py

Note: On certain version of python (e.g. 2.7.3~rc2-2.1 ) dns lookup is
      performed for each request, and cause a delay in response.
      To avoid this, one can either upgrade python, fix their resolv.conf or use
      the fix at the end of this file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Fix for librpcxml to avoid doing reverse dns on each request
# it was causing a 10s delay on each request when no reverse DNS was avalaible
import BaseHTTPServer


def not_insane_address_string(self):
    host, port = self.client_address[:2]
    return '%s (reverse DNS disabled)' % host  # used to call: socket.getfqdn(host)

BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.address_string = not_insane_address_string

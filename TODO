To be done :
    Update the USAGE > OPTION > Tunnel & Peers options section of the re6stnet
    man page ( about how tunnel options are treated ).

    Do a 'real' test, on one ( or more ) real machine(s) preferably :
       - package re6stnet
       - install re6stnet
       - follow the HOW TO section of the man page to setup a network
       - see if it works....

    Put more information in the token mail ( registry ), such as :
        - the ip address of the network being built
        - the creator of the network ( add option in registry ? )

    Make sure the re6stnet ip address is added on only one interface
    ( tweak the ovpn-server script ), else duplicate addresses appears in routing
    tables.

    Use an algorithm to choose which connections to keep and/or establish
    instead of pure randomness
        number of routes / tunnel

    Warn babeld about the tunnels wich are about to be deleted. Maybe we could just increase the cost.

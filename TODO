To be done :
    Use an algorithm to choose which connections to keep and/or establish
    instead of pure randomness
        number of routes / tunnel

    ( Write docstrings for all class/methods/functions )
    	
    Use latency in babeld

    Warn babeld about the tunnels wich are about to be deleted. Maybe we could just increase the cost.

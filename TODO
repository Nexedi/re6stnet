Bug :
    Peers stay connected to the bootstrap node so none can enter
    possible bug in the upnp refresh
    possible freeze in the regisrty

To be done :
    test with python 2.6
    Choose peer DB size.
    Choose the number of peer we ask to the server
    Warn babeld about the tunnels wich are about to be deleted. Maybe we could just increase the cost.

    Do a test, on one ( or more ) real machine(s) preferably :
       - package re6stnet
       - install re6stnet
       - follow the HOW TO section of the man page to setup a network
       - see if it works....


    Put more information in the token mail ( registry ), such as :
        - the ip address of the network being built
        - the creator of the network ( add option in registry ? )

    Fix bootstrap problem :
        registry & --private option ( see re6stnet man page HOW TO ).
        one have to start the registry twice, the first time without
        the --private option

    Put a section about how to build the package from the sources in the README

    Remove unnecessary information when sending a request to the server

Bugs :
    When no peer is avalaible without the --no-boot option, it crash

To be done :
    Replace comments at the beginning of functions with docstrings
    Do a clean-up in the import

To be discuss:
    Remove the --no-boot option since we know when no node is avalaible

    The organisation of the code
        vifibnet.py         Just contain the main loop and the init
        openpvn.py          To launch openvpn processes
        utils.py            Small functions to do some usefull job, also contains the config
        db.py               Function to access the DB (merge with utils ?)
        tunnelmanager.py    To choose wich connection delete/keep/...
        upnpigd.py          To open a port and find the external IP

    How we choose which protocol we use :
        IMO, we should use UDP. I've read many times than TCP other TCP can be catastrophic in terme of performance 
        Every time a packet is lost, it is resend 2 times, one for each TCP tunnel
        And many GW allow UDP port forwarding (for bittorent, Xbox, ...) but not TCP port forwarding

    Use peers_db.populate(100) every once in a while ? -> yes but be warry of the refresh time ( populate
    the db once every 20s is bad.. )

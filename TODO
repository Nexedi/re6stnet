Bug :
    Peers stay connected to the bootstrap node so none can enter
    re6stnet adress should appear on only one interface
    Bug in the upnp refresh

Check :
    Check that boostrap nodes work as intended


To be done :
    Choose the metric to add to bootstrap peers
    Choose peer DB size.
    Choose the number of peer we ask to the server
    Compare prefixes when 2 tunnels are established between the 2 same machines
    Warn babeld about the tunnels wich are about to be deleted. Maybe we could 
        just increase the cost.

    Do a test, on one ( or more ) real machine(s) preferably :
       - package re6stnet
       - install re6stnet
       - follow the HOW TO section of the man page to setup a network
       - see if it works....

    Put more information in the token mail ( registry ), such as :
        - the ip address of the network being built
        - the creator of the network ( add option in registry ? )

    Make sure the re6stnet ip address is added on only one interface
    ( tweak the ovpn-server script ), else duplicate addresses appears in routing
    tables.

    Fix bootstrap problem :
        registry & --private option ( see re6stnet man page HOW TO ).
        one have to start the registry twice, the first time without
        the --private option

    Put a section about how to build the package from the sources in the README

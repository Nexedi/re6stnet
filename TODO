- Test the package

- Put more information in the token mail (registry), such as:

  - the ip address of the network being built
  - the creator of the network ( add option in registry ? )

- Fix bootstrap problem:

  registry & --private option ( see re6stnet man page HOW TO ).
  one have to start the registry twice, the first time without
  the --private option

- Put a section about how to build the package from the sources in the README

- review protocol to discover pair:

  A node that that wants to establish a new tunnel just have to look at the
  routing table and pick a random destination node, actually its re6nst subnet.
  If its address is unknown (not in local cache), re6st queries it by sending a
  UDP packet to the subnet (anycast, i.e. IP suffix is 0): the reply is also an
  UDP packet containing the address string to establish a tunnel. Then, the
  tunnel can be established.

  For bootstrapping, no destination is known so one has to query the registry
  as already implemented. The way the registry discovers node addresses should
  be changed so that nodes don't need to declare themselves anymore.
  The registry should look at the local peer DB cache.

  This new protocol should produce less network trafic than the current one.

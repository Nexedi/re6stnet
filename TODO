To be done :
    Use an algorithm to choose which connections to keep and/or establish
    instead of pure randomness
        number of routes / tunnel

    README : move options doc elsewhere, make it look like a real readme
	
    Use latency in babeld

    Warn babeld about the tunnels wich are about to be deleted. Maybe we could just increase the cost.

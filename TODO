Bugs :
    Find a name for the project : the projet is ( or should be ) independant from vifib, openvpn, babel,
         and so should the name; btw we aim to build a distributed, scalable, resilient VPN....
    When no peer is avalaible without the --no-boot option, it crash => see below
    Once in a while, when exiting vifibnet ( not very properly, via Ctrl+C ), processes ( openvpn and babel )
         still remain and disturb further attemps ( must be killed for vifibnet to work again )
    Babel seems to be very long to establish the routes : maybe we should tell him thant we are not on a wired network but on a mobile network ?

To be done :
    Replace comments at the beginning of functions with docstrings & give all fn docstrings
    Use the server events ( client connection/deconnection ) to do something usefull
    In peers DB, remove some peers when they are too many of them
    Contact the server using vifibnet and not the underlying network when possible
    Use a timeout for the peersDB
    The peer DB size should depend on the number of connection and the refresh time
    Specify a lease duration in ForwardViaUPnP

To be discuss:
    U : Remove the --no-boot option since we know when no node is avalaible
    G : the no-boot option is only useful when the server knows no peer,
        irl it should never happen, no-boot is a debug option
    U : Ok, but the server knows when no peers is avalaible, doesn't he ?

    G : don't reconnect to server each time we repopulate in peers_db ?
    U : From what I've read on the internet, when you create a server object, you don't connect to the server,
        You only connect to the server once you send a request for a methode and then you can automatically use the same connection for 15sec

    Use more than one boostrap node

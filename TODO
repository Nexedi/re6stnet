To be done :
    Use an algorithm to choose which connections to keep and/or establish
    instead of pure randomness
        number of routes / tunnel
        favorise most used roads

    Write docstrings for all class/methods/functions

    We should replace dead connection much more often than we refresh tunnels otherwise, it brings instability
    	If we do this, we must protect some tunnels

   Project name ? Resinet/resnet/rsnet

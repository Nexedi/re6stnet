To be done :
    Male sure the re6stnet ip address is added on only one interface
    ( tweak the ovpn-server script ), else duplicate addresses appears in routing
    tables.

    Use an algorithm to choose which connections to keep and/or establish
    instead of pure randomness
        number of routes / tunnel

    Warn babeld about the tunnels wich are about to be deleted. Maybe we could just increase the cost.

URGENT => Name ideas :
    resnet ( for Resiliable NET )
    rsnet ( Resiliable Scalable NET )

To be done :
    Use an algorithm to choose which connections to keep and/or establish
    instead of pure randomness
        number of routes / tunnel
        favorise most used roads

    Handle LAN internally in order not to have catastrophic results ....
        pb : someone who has a lan acces to our network can provide false
        informations. Needs of signature
        => yeah it is a security problem to fix

    Write docstrings for all class/methods/functions

    Handle corrupt peers DB gracefully


To be discussed:
    U : Babel seems to be very long to establish the routes : maybe we should
        tell him thant we are not on a wired network but on a mobile network ?
    G : babel establish routes quickly enough i'd say. There are two new
        options : hello and wireless, for hello_interval and treating all
        interfaces as wireless. However, treating an interface as wireless
        doesn't lessen the hello_interval, it only changes how babel estimates
        quality link, and cost.
    U : from babel web page : "When the Babel daemon detects a wired network,
        it will use a larger interval between hellos".
        Moreover, it seems that the wireless option only means
        "hostile environment" which seems best for a resilient network.
        30 sec of hello interval seams also too much. The default value for
        babel is 4 sec (from babel man page).
        According to raphael's stats on the nexedi's server downtime,
        45% of the problems dont last more than 2 minutes, 55% no more than
        3 minutes If it takes 2 min to detect a dead connection, then we wont be
        solving many problems with our overlay network
    G : ok, so babel hello-interval should be set to a lower value,
        we should do some tests to pinpoint the best compromise between
        speed and bandwith usage.
        Btw, is there a doc ( pdf, image, file ) resuming Raphael's stats
        on nexedi's server downtime ? it could be useful for the internship
        rapport
    G : It takes babel between 3 times and 4 times the hello interval to
        reestablish connection, if a direct link is cut
    U : So we have to reduce the hello interval. 2min to detect a dead link is
        far too much.
    G : k

- Put more information in the token mail (registry), such as:

  - the ip address of the network being built
  - the creator of the network ( add option in registry ? )

- Babel limitations:

  - Babel must be able to set source address on routes it installed. Otherwise,
    a wrong IP will be selected if managed interfaces already have several
    public IPv6. If there's only one interface like this, a workaround is to
    use --main-interface option on it.

- Nodes should not have to generate their own DH parameters. Add a `getDh(cn)`
  registry RPC that is called at re6stnet startup if they're missing.

- Filter non-routable IPs. Add an option not to do it.

- Abort in case of import child process failure (babel, openvpn server,
  openvpn client if run with --client).

- registry: add '--home PATH' command line option so that / display an HTML
  page from PATH (use new str.format for templating)

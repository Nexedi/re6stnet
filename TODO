- Test the package

- Put more information in the token mail (registry), such as:

  - the ip address of the network being built
  - the creator of the network ( add option in registry ? )

- Fix bootstrap problem:

  registry & --private option ( see re6stnet man page HOW TO ).
  one have to start the registry twice, the first time without
  the --private option

- Babel limitations:

  - The metric does not take latency into account.
  - re6stnet needs to communicate with Babel so that only unused tunnels are
    freed. For the moment, routes will be randomly broken throughout the
    network, from time to time, for small amounts of time.
  - Babel must be able to set source address on routes it installed. Otherwise,
    a wrong IP will be selected if managed interfaces already have several
    public IPv6. If there's only one interface like this, a workaround is to
    use --main-interface option on it.

- Is it useful that each node regenerates its own DH parameter ?

- Filter non-routable IPs. Add an option not to do it.

- Abort in case of import child process failure (babel, openvpn server,
  openvpn client if run with --client).

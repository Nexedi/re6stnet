        number of routes / tunnel

    ( Write docstrings for all class/methods/functions )

To be discussed:
   Project name ?
           Resinet/res(6)net/rs(6)net
           ResiliAnt ( ants : find shortest paths, don't die easily
                            ~ are resilients )
           rescan6

Bug :
    possible bug in the upnp refresh, when refreshing after a too long time
    
To be done :
    Choose peer DB size.
    Choose the number of peer we ask to the server
    Test the package

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Put more information in the token mail ( registry ), such as :
        - the ip address of the network being built
        - the creator of the network ( add option in registry ? )

    Fix bootstrap problem :
        registry & --private option ( see re6stnet man page HOW TO ).
        one have to start the registry twice, the first time without
        the --private option

    Put a section about how to build the package from the sources in the README

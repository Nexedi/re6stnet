Bugs :
    When no peer is avalaible without the --no-boot option, it crash

To be done :
    Do a clean-up in the import

To be discuss:
    Remove the --no-boot option since we know when no node is avalaible

    Find a better solution for config than utils.config = config, openv.config = config, ...
    
    When I created PeersDB, I thought only be used to access the DB and not do some logic. 
        We should decide what it is suppose to do :
            Just access the DB
            Or manage the peers
    
    The organisation of the code
        vifibnet.py             Just contain the main loop and the init
        openpvn.py          To launch openvpn processes
        utils.py            Small functions to do some usefull job, also contains the config
        db.py               Function to access the DB (merge with utils ?)
        tunnelmanager.py    To choose wich connection delete/keep/...
        upnpigd.py          To open a port and find the external IP
    
    How we choose which protocol we use :
        IMO, we should use UDP. I've read many times than TCP other TCP can be catastrophic in terme of performance 
        Every time a packet is lost, it is resend 2 times, one for each TCP tunnel
        And many GW allow UDP port forwarding (for bittorent, Xbox, ...) but not TCP port forwarding

    Use peers_db.populate(100) every once in a while ?

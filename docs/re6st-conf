    --server address
             Ip address of the machine running the re6stnet server. Both ipv4
             and ipv6 addresses are supported.

    --port port
             Port to connect to on the machine running the re6stnet server.

    -d, --dir directory
            Path of a directory where will be stored the files generated by the
            setup. The Setup genereates the following files, in the explicit
            order :
            - ca.pem : certificate authority file downloaded from the server
            - peers.db : peers database initialized for re6stnet.py
            - cert.key : private key generated by the script
            - cert.crt : individual certificate file generated by the server
            - dh2048.pem : dh file for oenvpn server

    -r, --req name value
            Specify an attribute to add to the certificate request sent to the
            server. Can be used multiple times.
            Each use of the --req name value, will add the attribute name with
            the associated value in the sugbject of the certificate request.

    --ca-only
            Stop the script after downloading the certificate authority file
            from the server

    --db-only
            Stop the script after creating the peers DB and downloading the
            connection information of a bootstrap node of the VPN.

    --no-boot
            Does not re'quest a bootstrap peer to the peer discovery server
            (useful in debug when the server does not have any peer in his
            database). When requesting a bootstrap peer to a server whoch does
            not have any, an execption will occur, and the script will stop

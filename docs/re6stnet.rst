SYNOPSIS
========

``re6stnet`` ``--registry`` `registry-url` ``--dh`` `dh-path`
``--ca`` `ca-path` ``--cert`` `cert-path` ``--key`` `key-path`
[`options`...] [``--`` [`openvpn-options`...]]

DESCRIPTION
===========

`re6stnet` runs a node of a re6st network. It establishes connections
with other nodes by creating OpenVPN tunnels and uses Babel for routing.

USAGE
=====

Use ``re6stnet --help`` to get the complete list of options.

If you already have IPv6 connectivity by autoconfiguration and still want to
use it for communications that are unrelated to this network, then:

- your kernel must support source address based routing (because you can't
  use ``--default`` option).
- you must set ``net.ipv6.conf.<iface>.accept_ra`` sysctl to value 2 and
  trigger SLAAC with ``rdisc6 <iface>`` to restore the default route if the
  kernel removed while enabling forwarding.

Following environment variables are available for processes started with
``--up`` or ``--daemon``:

re6stnet_iface
  value of ``--main-interface`` option
re6stnet_ip
  IPv6 set on main interface
re6stnet_subnet
  your subnet, written in CIDR notation
re6stnet_network
  the re6st network you belong to, written in CIDR notation

Setting up a UPnP server
------------------------

In order to share the connectivity with others, it is necessary for re6stnet
port (as specified by ``--pp`` option and default to `1194`) to be reachable
from outside. If the node has a public IPv4 address, then this is not
necessary, otherwise a UPnP server should be set up on the gateway.

You can check the connectivity with other re6st nodes of the network with
``netstat -tn | grep 1194``.

Sample configuration file for `miniupnpd`::

  ext_ifname=ppp0
  listening_ip=eth0
  clean_ruleset_interval=600
  allow 1024-65535 192.168.0.0/24 1024-65535
  deny 0-65535 0.0.0.0/0 0-65535

After restarting ``re6stnet`` service on the clients within the LAN, you can
either check ``/var/log/re6stnet.log`` or the ``iptables`` ``NAT`` table to
see that the port ``1194`` is properly redirected, for example::

  # iptables -t nat -L -nv
  [...]
  Chain MINIUPNPD (1 references)
  target     prot opt source               destination
  DNAT       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:37194 to:192.168.0.5:1194
  DNAT       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:34310 to:192.168.0.233:1194

Starting re6st automatically
----------------------------

If the `/etc/re6stnet/re6stnet.conf` configuration file exists, `re6stnet` is
automatically started as a system daemon, by ``systemd``\ (1). Debian package
also provides SysV init scripts.

Important note about ``--default`` option
-----------------------------------------

When re6st is configured to route all your IPv6 traffic (``--default``),
any other interface providing IPv6 must have no default route. Otherwise,
re6st either refuses to start or aborts if it detect a default route.

Correct usage of NetworkManager
-------------------------------

It is required to configure properly every connection defined in NetworkManager
because default settings are wrong and conflict with re6st. If ``--default`` is
used, then disable IPv6, else enable the following options in the [ipv6]
section::

   ignore-auto-routes=true
   never-default=true

In applets, these options are usually named:

- Ignore automatically obtained routes (KDE & Gnome)
- Use only for resources on this connection (KDE)
- Use this connection only for resources on its network (Gnome)


HOW TO
======

Joining an existing network
---------------------------

Once you know the registry URL of an existing network, use `re6st-conf` to get
a certificate::

  re6st-conf --registry http://re6st.example.com/

Use `-r` option to add public information to your certificate.
A token will be sent to the email you specify, in order to confirm your
subscription.
Files will be created by default in current directory and they are all
required for `re6stnet`::

  re6stnet --dh dh2048.pem --ca ca.crt --cert cert.crt --key cert.key \
           --registry http://re6st.example.com/

Setting a new network
---------------------

First you need to know the prefix of your network: let's suppose it is
`2001:db8:42::/48`. From it, you computes the serial number of the Certificate
authority (CA) that will be used by the registry node to sign delivered
certificates, as follows: translate the significant part to hexadecimal
(ie. 20010db80042) add a **1** as the most significant digit::

  openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -key ca.key -set_serial 0x120010db80042 \
              -days 365 -out ca.crt

(see ``re6st-registry --help`` for examples to create key/dh files)

The CA email will be used as sender for mails containing tokens.
The registry can now be started::

  re6st-registry --ca ca.crt --key ca.key --mailhost smtp.example.com

The registry uses the builtin HTTP server of Python. For security, it should be
behind a proxy like Apache.

The first registered node should be always up because its presence is used by
all other nodes to garantee they are connected to the network. The registry
also emits UDP packets that are forwarded via a localhost re6st node, and it is
recommended that this is the first one::

  re6st-conf --registry http://localhost/

If `re6st-conf` is run in the directory containing CA files, ca.crt will be
overridden without harm. See previous section for more information to create
a node.

For bootstrapping, you may have to explicitly set an IP in the configuration
of the first node, via the ``--ip`` option. Otherwise, additional nodes won't
be able to connect to it.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

When many nodes are saturated or behind unconfigurated NAT, it may take
some time to bootstrap. However, if you really think something goes wrong,
you should first enable OpenVPN logs and increase verbosity:
see commented directives in configuration generated by `re6st-conf`.

Besides of firewall configuration described below, other security components
may also break re6st. For example, default SELinux configuration on Fedora
prevents execution of OpenVPN server processes.

Misconfigured firewall
----------------------

A common failure is caused by a misconfigured firewall. The following ports
need to be opened:

- **TCP/UDP ports 1194** (Specified by ``--pp`` option and default on `1194`):
  re6st launches several OpenVPN processes. Those in client mode may connect
  to any TCP/UDP port in IPv4. Server processes only listen to ports specified
  by ``--pp`` option.

- **UDP port 326**: used by re6st nodes to communicate. It must be open on all
  re6st IPv6.

- **UDP port 6696 on link-local IPv6 (fe80::/10)** on all interfaces managed
  by Babel: OpenVPN always aborts due to inactivity timeout when Babel paquets
  are filtered.

- **ICMPv6 neighbor-solicitation/neighbor-advertisement**. Moreover, the
  following ICMPv6 packets should also generally be allowed in an IPv6
  network: `destination-unreachable`, `packet-too-big`, `time-exceeded`,
  `parameter-problem`.

- **UDP source port 1900**: required for UPnP server (see `Setting up a UPnP
  server`_ for further explanations).

You can refer to `examples/iptables-rules.sh` for an example of iptables and
ip6tables rules.

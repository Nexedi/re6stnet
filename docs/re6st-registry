OPTIONS : RE6ST-REGISTRY
    usage : ./registry port [options...]
    port
            The port on which the server will listen

    --private ip
            Ipv6 address of the re6stnet client running on the machine. This
            address will be advertised only to nodes having a valid
            certificate.

    --db path
            Path to the server Database file. A new DB file will be created
            and correctly initialized if the file doesn't exists.
            One can give ":memory" as path, the database is then temporary

    --ca path
            Path to the certificate authority file. The certificate authority
            MUST contain the VPN network prefix in its serial number. To
            generate correct ca and key files for the 2001:db8:42:: prefix,
            the following command can be used :
            openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -key ca.key -set_serial \
                    0x120010db80042 -days 365 -out ca.crt

    --key path
            Path to the server key file. To generate a key file, see the --ca
            option

    --bootstrap prefix ip port proto
            Connection informations of a node given to other as a bootstrap
            node to initiate connection with the network.
            Prefix should be the prefix number of a node, given in binary and
            with correct length. For instance the VPN address
            2001:db8:42:1::/64 ( asusming a network prefix 2001:db8:42::/48 )
            corresponds to a prefix 1/16 i.e 0000000000000001.

    --mailhost mailhost
            Mailhost to be used to send email containing token for registration
